    '3': Buyer App

    '5': >-
      If set to “amount” it means Buyer App’s fee is a flat amount in INR.

      If set to “percent- annualized” it means the Buyer App’s fee is set as a
      percentage of the Total Loan Disbursed for a 12-month tenure loan.


      For example: Assume the Buyer App Fees’ value is 5%


      For a 12 month tenure loan the ‘effective fees’ paid by Seller App to the
      Buyer App would be 5% * (12 months/ 12 months) i.e 5%


      For 6 month tenure loan the ‘effective fees’ paid by Seller App to the
      Buyer App would be 5% * (6 months/ 12 months) i.e 2.5%


      For 18 month tenure loan the ‘effective fees’ paid by Seller App to the
      Buyer App would be 5% * (18 months/ 12 months) i.e 7.5%

      Quantum of the Buyer App’s Fee. To be interpreted in connection with the
      “type” field mentioned above.

      For example, let’s assume the value is set at “5”. If the “type” is set to
      “Amount”, that means the Buyer App Fee is INR 5. If the “type” is set to
      “percent - annualized”, it means the Buyer App Fee is 5% of the Total
      Order Value for a 12- month tenure loan.

      hours).

      Network Participant.

      For clarity, if the Buyer App is the Processing Fees collector, the Buyer
      App will deduct their Buyer finder fees from the Processing Fees and remit
      the balance to the Seller App. If seller app is the Processing Fees
      collector, the Seller app will remit the Buyer Finder Fees to Buyer App.

      The Payment Collector will use the selected method to remit the due
      payment to the counterparty Network Participant. To illustrate, if the
      Buyer App collects the payment and the Settlement Type is set to “rtgs”,
      when the settlement is due, the Buyer App will transfer the Seller App’s
      share of the Buyer Price to the Seller App’s account via RTGS.

      This is the annual rate of interest that the Payment Collector will be
      charged if they delay a payment to the counterparty Network Participant,
      calculated pro rata for each calendar day of delay. As an example, if the
      value is set as “7.3”, and the amount of payment due is INR 1000, that
      will mean the Payment Collector will pay the counterparty Network
      Participant an interest of 7.3% per annum (i.e. INR 100), calculated pro
      rata for each day of delay. So if the Payment Collector delay was 50 days,
      the total interest payable would be INR 10 [calculated as
      1000x(7.3/100)x(50/365)]

      Protocol. If there is a conflict between the terms decided through the
      Protocol, and the Static Terms, the terms decided through the ONDC
      Protocol will prevail. Also, if there is a conflict between the Static
      Terms and the ONDC Network Policy or the Static Terms and the Network
      Participant Agreement, the terms of the ONDC Network Policy or the Network
      Participant Agreement (as the case may be) will prevail.
